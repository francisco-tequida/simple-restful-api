# Documentation
This project implements the [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) specification via [drf-yasg](https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). You can find it by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger on your browser once the project is running.

# Testing API
Inside *tests* folder you will find the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) [collection](https://www.postman.com/collection/) and [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) used to test this API.

Most paths require [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) authorization. You can get a JWT token by querying to **/api/token/** with a valid username/password as the ones mentioned in the **User types and restrictions** section.

# Containerization
Both, **API** and **BD** run as services, so, docker compose is recommended. 

# Notification system
This project uses [**SendGrid**](https://sendgrid.com/) as notification system.

> You need to create an [**API KEY**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys) and add it to the env variables.

> You need a [**Verified Sender Address**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/senders) and add it to the env variables.

> You need a [**Dynamic Template ID**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates) and add it to the env variables. The minimum variables expected to be found inside the templeta are: *prev_sku*, *curr_sku*, *prev_name*, *curr_name*, *prev_price*, *curr_price*, *prev_brand*, *curr_brand*

# Proposal for the future
> We can split the monolithic application into services. Each application would be a service.

> From every service we can create an image and upload it to a cloud image registry.

> From every image we could create a kubernetes service loadbalancing the total amount of requests.
